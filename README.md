# Qlik Analysis Of Road Safety And Accident Patterns In India
## 1.Project Description:- 
   ## Project Overview:
  ## Specify The Business Problem: 
   The project aims to address the pressing issue of road accidents in India by utilizing Qlik's data analytics platform. With a high frequency of accidents across the country, there is a need to identify trends, hotspots, and factors contributing to these accidents to improve road safety measures, reduce accidents, and save lives.
  ## Business Requirements:
  The project requires leveraging various data sources such as traffic data, accident reports, weather conditions, road infrastructure details, and demographic information. Through advanced analytics techniques, the platform aims to pinpoint regions or specific roads with a high frequency of accidents, identify patterns and recurring factors leading to accidents, and forecast potential accident scenarios based on real-time data inputs. 
  ## Literature Survey:
  A comprehensive literature survey will be conducted to gather insights and best practices in road safety analytics, accident pattern analysis, and predictive modeling. This will include studying existing research papers, reports, and case studies related to road safety initiatives, accident prevention strategies, and data-driven decision-making in transportation management.

## Social Impact:

The project social impact can be divided into following parts:

Demographic Distribution Visualization: We will create visualizations to represent demographic distribution of accidents throughout the nation and help the stakeholders to understand the population segments affected by accidents.

Severity Comparison: Accident severity comparison in different traffic control areas to prioritize intervention measures and allocate resources.
Correlation Exploration: There might be correlation between speeding, weather and total accidents and we need to explore this aspects to identify risk factors and suggest appropriate intervention measures.

Leading Causes Identification: We need to identify the leading causes of accidents through data and use the information to organize awareness programs and reform policies to address the underlying causes.

Age and Gender Distribution Examination: We will examine age groups and gender of the accident victims to target our road safety measures and educational programs.
Vehicle Contribution Analysis: We will examine contribution of different vehicle categories to total accidents and use the information to regulate the number of vehicles and ensure safety standards for each category of vehicles.
## 2. Data Collection
Dataset: Nine Excel files containing state/UT-wise data on various aspects of road accidents, including pedestrian involvement, fatalities, impact of vehicles, traffic control types, weather conditions, causes of accidents, and accident severity.

## 3. Data Preparation
Prepared the dataset for visualization by cleaning, transforming, and structuring the data to make it suitable for analysis.

## 4. Data Visualizations
Created a variety of visualizations to represent different aspects of the data, such as bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and pie charts, to provide insights into pedestrian demographics, vehicle impacts, traffic control effectiveness, weather-related accidents, causes of accidents, and accident severity.

## 5. Dashboard
Designed a responsive and user-friendly dashboard using Qlik Sense to consolidate all the visualizations and provide an interactive platform for exploring the data.

## 6. Story
Developed a narrative or story based on the insights gleaned from the data visualizations, highlighting key findings, trends, and actionable recommendations to address road safety issues.

## 7. Performance Testing
Evaluated the performance of the dashboard by assessing the rendering speed, data filtering capabilities, and the complexity of calculations and visualizations.

## 8. Project Demonstration & Documentation
Recorded a comprehensive explanation video demonstrating the end-to-end solution, showcasing the dashboard functionality and insights derived from the analysis.

Created detailed project documentation outlining the step-by-step development procedure, including data collection, preparation, visualization techniques, dashboard design, story creation, performance testing, and key findings.

By following this structured approach, the project aims to provide valuable insights into road safety issues and facilitate informed decision-making for stakeholders involved in traffic management and urban planning.

The project objectives are aligned with the above social impact aspects and i hope the solution will help the government, transport and road safety organizations to take data driven decisions and mitigate risks related to road accidents in India.
